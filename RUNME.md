# Considerations before starting: 
- [**What you need from Azure Entra ID?**](#0-what-you-need-from-azure-entra-id)
- **Public Client** vs. **Private Client**
- **Multi-tenant** vs. **Single-tenant**
- **Access tokens** vs "**ID tokens**
- **implicit flows** vs. **hybrid flows**
- **Platforms** & **OAuth flow restrictions**
    - **SPA**: Must use browser-based CORS requests (JavaScript fetch/XMLHttpRequest)
    - **Mobile/Desktop** (PublicClient): Allows server-side token exchange with PKCE
    - **Web**: Requires client authentication (secret/certificate)
 
# 0. What you need from Azure Entra ID?

- **Public Client (PKCE only)**
  - `Tenant ID` (or domain)
  - `Client ID`
  - `Redirect URI(s)` (registered as public client)
  - `Scopes` (openid profile offline_access + APIs)
  - `Code challenge/verifier` (runtime-generated, not from Entra)

ðŸ‘‰ **No client secret**.

- **Confidential Client (Secret or Certificate)**
  - `Tenant ID` (or domain)
  - `Client ID`
  - `Redirect URI(s)`
  - `Scopes`
  - `Client secret` or `certificate` (securely stored)
  - (Optional) `PKCE` support - `Code challenge/verifier`

ðŸ‘‰ **PKCE + secret/cert = strongest protection.**

# 1. Public vs. Private App

### **Public Client**
- An application that **cannot safely store secrets** (e.g., mobile apps, SPAs, CLI tools).
- Uses **PKCE to protect against code interception**.
- Does **not authenticate** with a **client secret**.
- **No secure server-side environment**
- In public clients, all code executes **on devices** you donâ€™t control.
- Unlike a backend server, thereâ€™s **no trusted**, **isolated runtime** to protect the secret.

### **Confidential Client (Private)**
- An application that can **safely store secrets** (e.g., server-side apps, daemons).
- Uses **client secret** or **certificate for authentication**.
- Can also use **PKCE as an additional security layer**.

| Aspect                 | Public Client (PKCE only)           | Confidential Client (Secret/Cert + PKCE optional) |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Secret storage**     | No secret (unsafe environment)      | Secret or certificate securely stored             |
| **PKCE usage**         | Required                            | Optional (but recommended)                        |
| **Security guarantee** | Proof-of-possession (via PKCE) only | Secret-based authentication + optional PKCE       |
| **Use cases**          | Mobile apps, SPAs, CLI tools        | Server-side apps, web APIs, background services   |


### Access tokens (used for implicit flows) vs. ID tokens (used for implicit and hybrid flows)





# How to configure? 

# 1. Azure AD Configuration Changes Required
### 1. Enable Public Client Flows
- In our Azure AD app registration:
- Go to Authentication â†’ Advanced settings
- Set "Allow public client flows" to Yes
This is the crucial setting that tells Azure AD this app can use PKCE without a client secret

### 2. Verify Platform Configuration
- In Authentication â†’ Platform configurations
- Make sure you have a Mobile/Desktop platform configured
- Add redirect URI: `http://localhost:8080/auth/callback`
- Enable ID tokens checkbox

If we chose Web platform configured (not Mobile/Desktop) - we should have this issue "Tokens issued for the 'Single-Page Application' client-type may only be redeemed via cross-origin requests."
This means Microsoft expects SPA applications to make token requests from the browser using CORS, not from a server-side application. 
Our FastAPI app is making a server-to-server POST request, which Microsoft blocks for SPA platform types.
Since our FastAPI app makes server-side HTTP requests (not browser CORS requests), you need the Mobile/Desktop platform type, which allows public clients to make server-side token requests with PKCE protection.

Change our manifest from:

```
"replyUrlsWithType": [
    {
        "url": "http://localhost:8080/auth/callback",
        "type": "Spa"
    }
]
```
To:

```
"replyUrlsWithType": [
    {
        "url": "http://localhost:8080/auth/callback",
        "type": "PublicClient"
    }
]
```

### 3. Remove Any Client Secrets (Optional)
- Go to Certificates & secrets
- You can delete any existing client secrets since they won't be used

### 4. Verify API Permissions

In API permissions, ensure you have:

openid
profile
email
offline_access
